Notes:

Shared components go in components/.

Each route has its own folder in app/.

node_modules/ is managed by pnpm and should not be committed.

3️⃣ Branching Workflow

Create a feature branch locally from your department branch:

git checkout -b home-section frontend


(Replace frontend with backend if needed)

Push the branch

git push origin home-section


Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting your department branch (frontend or backend).

Do not PR directly to devs or main.

Keep PRs focused on a single feature.

After approval, your feature branch merges into the department branch.

Department branches later merge into devs → main.

4️⃣ Best Practices

Always pull the latest changes before starting a new feature:

git checkout frontend
git pull origin frontend
git checkout -b new-feature


Use pnpm commands exclusively (pnpm install, pnpm dev, pnpm add <package>).
